For this iteration of the portfolio project I used framework boootstrap for the design. I was intially unsure of how to effectively use this so I watched some youtube videos by "Net Ninja" to learn how to implement and use this. I kept a relatively similar design to the old site but with the help of bootstrap it looks much cleaner. I also simplified the home page so I could direct the content I previously had there to the other pages, which I felt was a good choice, as it seemed to conflict with the "about me" page originally. I also now have the 'home' link as just "Tom Reich Outdoors" in the top left, to be honest I'm still not totally sure about this choice. I think the changed home button looks good but I feel like it may not be immeditely obvious that the text there is actually a link. Additionally, I refocused the website to just be about the outdoors, where as last time I focused on tech and the outdoors which I felt got too messy and confusing.
